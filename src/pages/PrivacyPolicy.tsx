        Information in Compliance with Personal Data Protection Regulations
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Management / Governing Body of <strong>BRAIN REPO S.L.</strong>{" "}
        (hereinafter referred to as the data controller) assumes the highest
        level of responsibility and commitment to establishing, implementing,
        and maintaining this Data Protection Policy, ensuring continuous
        improvement of the data controller with the aim of achieving excellence
        in compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament
        and of the Council of April 27, 2016, on the protection of natural
        persons regarding the processing of personal data and on the free
        movement of such data, which repeals Directive 95/46/EC (General Data
        Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119/1, 04-05-2016), as well as Spanish
        personal data protection regulations (Organic Law, specific sector
        legislation, and its implementing regulations).
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Data Protection Policy of <strong>BRAIN REPO S.L.</strong> is based
        on the principle of proactive responsibility, whereby the data
        controller is accountable for compliance with the regulatory and
        jurisprudential framework governing this Policy and is able to
        demonstrate such compliance to the competent supervisory authorities.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In this regard, the data controller is guided by the following
        principles, which serve as a reference and guide for all its personnel
        in the processing of personal data:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Data protection by design:</strong> The data controller shall
          apply—both when determining the means of processing and at the time of
          the actual processing—appropriate technical and organizational
          measures, such as pseudonymization, designed to effectively implement
          data protection principles (such as data minimization) and to
          integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data protection by default:</strong> The data controller shall
          apply the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure
          that, by default, only personal data that is necessary for each
          specific processing purpose is processed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data protection throughout the information lifecycle:</strong>{" "}
          Measures that ensure the protection of personal data shall be
          applicable throughout the entire lifecycle of the information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency:</strong> Personal data
          shall be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently in relation to
          the data subject.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purpose limitation:</strong> Personal data shall be collected
          for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and shall not be
          further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data minimization:</strong> Personal data shall be adequate,
          relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
          for which it is processed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Personal data shall be accurate and, where
          necessary, kept up to date. All reasonable steps shall be taken to
          ensure that personal data that is inaccurate with respect to the
          purposes for which it is processed is erased or rectified without
          delay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage limitation:</strong> Personal data shall be kept in a
          form that permits the identification of data subjects for no longer
          than is necessary for the purposes of the personal data processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integrity and confidentiality:</strong> Personal data shall be
          processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security of the
          personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful
          processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using
          appropriate technical or organizational measures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information and training:</strong> One of the keys to ensuring
          the protection of personal data is the training and information
          provided to the personnel involved in its processing. Throughout the
          information lifecycle, all personnel with access to the data shall be
          properly trained and informed about their obligations regarding
          compliance with data protection regulations.
        </li>
      </ol>
